I am a physicist interested in the macroscopic phenomena that emerge in biological populations, focusing on topics such as population survival in heterogeneous environment, self-organization and ecosystem diversity. I received my doctoral degree in 2018, at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), with the thesis “Collective behavior of living beings under spatiotemporal environmental fluctuations”, advised by prof. Celia Anteneodo. From 2018 to 2020, I was a Postdoctoral researcher at IFISC (Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems), working with profs. Emilio Hernández-García and Cristóbal López. At the moment, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University under the supervision of professors Corina Tarnita (Departament of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University) and Juan Bonachela (Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources, Rutgers University).

I'm a physicist broadly interested in understanding emergent phenomena in biological and ecological processes. Most of my previous studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms behind the spatial organization and its ecological consequences. Recently, using theoretical models, collaborations and I have been making an effort to provide a two-way connection between small and large scales. From the bottom-up, it takes an essential step to foresee ecosystem response due to shifts in environmental constraints. From the top-down, it allows us to read small-scale dynamics from large-scale observations.

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral research associate at <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/ctarnita/home">Tarnita</a> (EEB, Princeton University) and <a href="http://www.ugr.es/~jabonachela/">Bonachela</a> (Rutgers University, DEENR) Labs. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at IFISC (Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems) working with <a href="https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/users/emilio/">E. Hernández-García</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HPapE6oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">C. López</a>. During my PhD, I was advised by
