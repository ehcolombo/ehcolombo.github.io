I'm a physicist interested in the macroscopic phenomena that emerge in biological populations, focusing on topics such as population survival in heterogeneous environment, self-organization and ecosystem diversity. I received my doctoral degree in 2018, at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), with the thesis “Collective behavior of living beings under spatiotemporal environmental fluctuations”. I worked at the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (IFISC) under the supervision of Emilio Hernández-García and Cristóbal López (2018-2020). Currently, I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate under the supervision of Corina Tarnita and Juan Bonachela, at the Departament of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University (2020-).
