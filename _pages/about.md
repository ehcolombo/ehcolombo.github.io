I'm a physicist interested in the macroscopic phenomena that emerge in biological populations, focusing on topics such as population survival in heterogeneous environment, self-organization and ecosystem diversity. I received my doctoral degree in 2018, at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), with the thesis “Collective behavior of living beings under spatiotemporal environmental fluctuations”. I worked for two years at the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (IFISC) under the supervision of Emilio Hernández-García. Currently, I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Departament of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University.
